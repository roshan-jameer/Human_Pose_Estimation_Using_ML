# human-pose-estimation
Overview:
This project focuses on human pose estimation, the process of detecting and tracking human joints (keypoints) to predict body posture from images or videos. Using machine learning and deep learning techniques, this project delivers an accurate and efficient model capable of recognizing complex poses.


Features:
Detects keypoints of human joints (e.g., head, shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.).
Supports both static images and real-time video inputs.
Implements a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., OpenPose, MediaPipe, or PoseNet).
User-friendly interface for visualization of pose estimation.
Customizable for specific use cases like fitness tracking, dance movement analysis, or sports analytics.


Results:
The model achieves high accuracy for complex poses and diverse scenarios. Results can be visualized with overlaid keypoints and skeleton connections.


Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
OpenCV for image and video processing
NumPy for numerical computations
MediaPipe or PoseNet
